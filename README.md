- **Usage:** Run the script using Python 3. For example:

## Challenge 3: Generating a String with Equal Occurrences of Letters

- **File:** `challenge3.py`
- The solution function creates a string made up of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'). You specify how long the string should be by providing a number N. The function then makes sure that each letter from 'a' to 'z' appears an equal number of times in the string. For example, if you want a string of length 3, it might return something like 'abc'. If you want a string of length 5, it might return 'abcde'. And if you want a longer string, like of length 30, it ensures each letter repeats twice, like 'aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnoo'.
